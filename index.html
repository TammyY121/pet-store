					<p> Are you sure you want to take on the responsibility of this interesting creature? If so, he's all yours for $100!

					<h1>Meowing Creature</h1>
					<img src="https://www.royalcanin.com/~/media/Royal-Canin/Product-Categories/cat-adult-landing-hero.ashx"> 
					<p> She sheds lots of fur. If you are allergic, I advise you to not buy her. She is not hypo-allergenic. If you want to take the risk, buy her for $120!

					<h1>Scaly Creature</h1>

					<p> If you like grilled fish, this one is perfect to toss on the grill. I personally would just go to a resturant, but this is a fresher option. Buy for $25!

					<p>This is probably the most interesting animal we have in our store. It talks back, which usually results in it being returned to the store. It hasn't been adopted recently because of the rumors about it. I'm pretty sure that he didn't bite off that man's finger... He tries real hard to be loved though... PRECAUTION! Buy for FREE at your own risk! We're desperate!

					<p> Personally, this is my favorite. Its not like the Gavin, and you shouldn't have problems with it. Buy for $1000! He is the most adoooooorable thing! Never mind! It's not for sale! Very energetic.
